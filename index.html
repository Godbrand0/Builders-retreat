      <h1>I welcome you all to our 2025 Retreat!</h1>

        Today, we gather to Revitalize, Renew, and Reconnect with God and each
        other, based on Psalm 51:10-12.

        As we begin this journey, I encourage you to come with expectant hearts,
        ready to encounter God's presence. Let's open ourselves to His leading,
        allowing Him to rejuvenate our passion, faith, and relationship with Him
        and reconnect us to His purpose.

        During this retreat, let's be sensitive to the Holy Spirit's movement.
        Expect God to manifest His glory among us. Let's create an atmosphere
        where He can freely move, touching lives and transforming us.

        His presence.
